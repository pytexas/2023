# Parking
---
While at PyTexas you may park in the Austin Public Library parking garage while space is available. **This is a public parking garage and you will have to pay. You can find the rates [here](https://library.austintexas.gov/central/parking).** Just tell the parking attendant that you are here for the event.

The event will be starting before the library is open. **Be sure to use the South Elevator or stairs to Cesar Chavez to access the venue.** See the map below for directions.
