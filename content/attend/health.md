**These guidelines are up to date as of 15 November 2022*

### PyTexas 2023 Health and Safety Guidelines

Our attendees' health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and look to venue, local, state, and CDC guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements. 

**PyTexas has worked hard to be a community that is welcoming to all, including those of us who are immunocompromised, disabled, elderly, have support needs, or are caregivers for children, and those of us who share households with or caretake for people in those groups, so we will be erring on the side of safety for all participants.**

PyTexas will continue to provide social distancing where possible in the venue. Hand sanitizer will also be available for all attendees. The guidelines implemented for PyTexas 2023 are subject to change based on health and safety recommendations at the time of the event. We are committing, however, to only make changes in the direction of greater protections.

### Mask Requirement

Face coverings will be required of everyone inside the conference venue at PyTexas. This is necessary since PyTexas hosts attendees from all over the world who traveled in and may have unknowingly been exposed to COVID-19. This allows us to host the safest event possible for everyone in attendance. We will not be rolling back our mask requirement.

Exceptions are:

1.  Outdoor spaces
2.  Indoors while consuming food and while socially distanced from other participants
3.  While necessary for communicating with someone who is hearing impaired when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication
4.  Speakers while presenting

Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. [N95](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html) or equivalent masks are required. As N95 is an American standard, masks certified by other governments to similar standards (e.g. PM2.5, KN95, and KF94) will also be allowed. Speakers will not be required to wear masks while presenting. Participants should provide their own masks for the event, though extras will be available at no cost during the conference at the registration desk while supplies last. Participants who are unwilling to follow the mask requirement will be asked to leave and may convert their pass to a PyTexas Online ticket.

### Vaccination Requirement

PyTexas 2023 will require vaccination of all attendees, but we will not be requiring specific boosters since the availability and timing of boosters has varied so much from place to place. COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. As with other diseases, you are protected best from COVID-19 when you stay up to date with the recommended vaccines, including locally available boosters.

### Rapid Testing

We encourage attendees to do a rapid test before traveling and consider testing during the event, especially if you will be eating indoors with people. We did look into providing free, rapid onsite testing for participants but it is not feasible (logistically or financially) for an event like ours.

### Attendance

Individuals should not attend the event if they are COVID-positive, are exhibiting COVID symptoms ([as defined by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)), or have been exposed, within 7 days prior to the event, to someone who was COVID-positive or showed COVID symptoms.

If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, please contact us at pycon-reg@python.org, and we will exchange your ticket type for an online ticket or grant you a refund.

### Travel

Anyone traveling to the event should read and abide by the [CDC's Travel Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html) for domestic and international travel. We ask that participants respect fellow attendees and do everything possible to ensure an environment that is as safe as possible.

### Monitoring of the Requirements Will Continue

We've monitored COVID-related news and data since the pandemic started, and we will continue to do so moving forward. We continue to follow all CDC guidelines in addition to those of the local government and venue. International, national, regional, and local sources are closely watched and will result in a change of policy if warranted.

### Commitment to Compliance

PyTexas takes these Health & Safety Guidelines very seriously and will therefore enforce a 3-strike rule. Anyone who violates these guidelines on three separate accounts, such as continuing not to wear a proper mask or disregarding social distancing, is subject to removal from the conference.
