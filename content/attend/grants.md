Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wants to attend PyTexas can do so, regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, ability or sexual orientation. One way we make this possible is by providing financial assistance to community members that are otherwise unable to attend.

In addition to already subsidized rates for individuals, students and those under the age of eighteen, this grant can be used by those in need to cover registration fees, hotels, and travel. These opportunity grants come directly from the PyTexas budget on a case-by-case basis.

If your company is interested in contributing to our grants budget, consider becoming a [Diversity & Inclusion Sponsor](/sponsors/prospectus).

Currently we have a limited budget and are evaluating what we can provide. Tickets are generally the easiest thing to grant, and we are aiming to have some cash to help reimburse travel/lodging.

If you are facing a financial hardship, or would not be able to attend without assistance, please fill out the application below. Applications will be approved by Feb. 20<sup>th</sup> 2023.
