# Sponsor Prospectus
---

Presenting PyTexas 2023, the 13th Python Community Conference for the Texas Region. The purpose of PyTexas is to share Python-related knowledge and enthusiasm in the form of presentations, coding sprints, "teach me" sessions, and general networking among developers. It is run every year by volunteers from around the region.

In 2012, PyTexas received national recognition from former Python Software Foundation chair Steve Holden as a regional conference that deserves the Python community's support.

Please consider sponsoring PyTexas 2023 through a financial contribution to the non-profit PyTexas Foundation. Your contribution helps the Texas-area Python community build a better conference, while also providing a targeted marketing and community outreach opportunity.

We have provided this prospectus for potential sponsors to find out more about
the conference itself and available sponsorship opportunities. Our contact

## Why Sponsor?

As a sponsor, your funding assistance will serve three critical purposes:

1. Highlight your presence within the Texas Python community. You can use this to:
    - Recruit your next engineer
    - Drive adoption of your product
    - Simply show your support for the Texas Python community
1. Build a better PyTexas by enabling organizers to attract attendees with standard conference perks such as printed t-shirts, catering, professional A/V, and more.
1. Help keep the cost of PyTexas low. PyTexas 2023 attendees will pay a modest registration fee. Your sponsorship helps us keep this price reasonable for everyone involved.

## Sponsorship Opportunities

We offer several standard packages. However, if none of these seem to fit,

most of your investment in the Python community.

## About the Python Language

Python is a general purpose, open source programming language popular for its elegant, high-level, and cross-platform design. It is protected and promoted by the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/). The PSF also aids organizers of local conferences such as PyTexas with financial and logistical support.

Python has a wide range of practical uses, from simple scripts to large scale enterprise applications to high volume websites such as YouTube.

Python is used for system administration, web development, building GUI applications, scientific computing, game development, and as a "glue" language for systems integration, among other things. Python developers have many choices of runtime environments, including CPython, JVM (Jython), and .NET (IronPython).

See [http://www.python.org/about/quotes/](http://www.python.org/about/quotes/) to find out how organizations around the world are using Python.
