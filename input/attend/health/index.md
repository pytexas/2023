# 2022 Health and Safety Guidelines
---

<i>This page was last updated on December 31, 2021.</i>

## Mask Mandate
Based on recent data available from the [CDC and numerous research studies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fmore%2Fmasking-science-sars-cov2.html), face coverings will be required of everyone inside the conference venue at PyTexas US.

Exceptions are:

1. Outdoor spaces
1. Indoors while consuming food and while socially distanced from other participants
1. While necessary for communicating with someone who is hearing impaired when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication
1. Speakers while presenting

<b>Please note:</b> Other situations may arise in which removal of your mask may be necessary. We ask that you use your own discretion to decide for yourself based on the situation, taking into account these guidelines and the safety of those around you. Reference the [CDC Guide to Masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).

Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. [KN95 or N95](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/mask-fit-and-filtration.html) masks are recommended. Cloth masks are permitted, but must fit tightly around the nose and face, and, unless worn over a surgical mask, have at least 2 layers. Alternatives to face coverings such as face shields, loose gaiters, scarves, bandanas, and face coverings with ventilation are not permitted. Speakers will not be required to wear masks while presenting. Participants should provide their own masks for the event, though extras will be available at no cost during the conference at the registration desk while supplies last.

## Vaccination or Negative Test Requirement
All attendees will be required to provide proof of full vaccination of COVID-19 with a WHO-approved vaccine or a negative COVID test performed no more than 48 hours prior to the start of PyTexas 2022.

The verification process will happen at registration. You will be asked to present your vaccination card (either the original or a photo) or your negative COVID-19 test. Due to these requirements, everyone must register themselves in person. No one can do your registration for you.

The definition of full vaccination will be updated to conform to guidelines in place during the event. In accordance with national [US health policies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) and [CDC traveler policy](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html), people are currently considered fully vaccinated:

* 2 weeks (14 days) after your dose of an accepted single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine.
* 2 weeks (14 days) after your second dose of an accepted 2-dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines
* 2 weeks (14 days) after you received the full series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine (not placebo) in a clinical trial
* 2 weeks (14 days) after you received the full series of a Novavax (or Covovax) COVID-19 vaccine (not placebo) in a phase 3 clinical trial
* 2 weeks (14 days) after you received 2 doses of any “mix-and-match” combination of [accepted COVID-19 vaccines administered](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html#covid-vaccines) at least 17 days apart


While vaccination has been extremely important, it does not fully protect everyone; older persons and immunocompromised individuals are sometimes unable to mount a full response to the vaccine and are more likely to suffer complications if they do get infected. Thus, these individuals must rely on the vaccination of their surrounding community members so they may remain safe. Our vaccination policy is in place to increase the safety of all attendees at the conference.

Vaccinations today in the U.S. are freely available and are increasingly becoming available worldwide. We require that all attendees get fully vaccinated prior to the event to reduce the risk to both themselves and others! A U.S. based location guide [can be found here](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/).

## Attendance
Individuals should not attend the event if they are COVID-positive, are exhibiting COVID symptoms (as defined by the CDC), or have been exposed, within 14 days prior to the event, to someone who was COVID-positive or showed COVID symptoms.

If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, please contact us and we will exchange your ticket type for an online ticket or grant you a refund.

## Monitoring Will Continue
We’ve monitored COVID-related news and data since the pandemic started, and we will continue to do so moving forward. We continue to follow all CDC guidelines in addition to those of the local government and venue. International, national, regional, and local sources are closely watched and will result in a change of policy if warranted.

## Disclaimer
PyTexas takes these Health & Safety Guidelines very seriously and will therefore enforce a 3-strike rule. Anyone who violates these guidelines on three separate accounts, such as continuing to not wear a proper mask or disregard social distancing, is subject to removal from the conference. Anyone who provides false vaccination verification will not be admitted to PyTexas US.
