## Who should submit a proposal?
Everyone! We want all kinds of proposals from people of all experience levels. Whether you’ve never given a talk at a conference, or have given dozens. Whether you just discovered Python, or are an old hand. Whether you’re a programmer, designer, scientist, or music theorist (or whatever). We want to hear what you have to share!

## What should I give a talk on?
Your talk can be about anything related to the Python programming language or of interest to the Python community. Some specific areas that people have expressed interest in for talks this year include:

- General Python programming
- Web Applications
- Python Game Development
- DevOps
- GIS
- Scientific Computing
- AI/Machine Learning
- Software Testing
- Data Visualization
- Python in Education
- Open Source and Community
- And more!

Some other ideas might be:

- How you used Python to solve a specific problem.
- Your favorite Python library
- How to broaden diversity within the Python community.
- Development tools for Python (or written in Python)
- etc.

## Does PyTexas offer any financial support for speakers?
PyTexas is a community driven, volunteer-supported, not-for-profit conference with an “everybody pays” policy. This means that we ask everyone to purchase a ticket, and [offer financial support](/about/grants) to anyone that needs it, regardless of whether they are a speaker or not. If you have a talk accepted, and do not need financial aid in order to attend, you will need to purchase a ticket and provide your own accommodations.
