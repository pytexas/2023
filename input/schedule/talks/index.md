<h2>
Talk:
Choosing the Right Data Types
</h2>
<p>
So often, in Python, I’ve run up against the question of what type of data structure to use to express something. Does this need a tuple, a dict, a namedtuple, a dataclass, or something else? How do you select what to use, and what are the pros and cons? Let’s explore the options!

    </h5>
    <small>
I’m a test automation senior developer for a well known company. During my time, I have trained several junior developers, written millions of lines of code, maintained and supported that code, and pushed for process improvements around development standards, code review, design, and support. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to do things “right”, and how to teach other people.

Outside of work, I’m a dad of 2 nerdy kids, an improv comedian, movie lover, and drinker of beer and coffee.

<h2>
Talk:
Event-Driven Microservices with Flask and Apache Kafka
</h2>
<p>
Implementing complex systems with microservices can be a great decision, but if we’re not careful we can end up with a distributed monolith. Let’s see how to avoid that by building lightweight, loosely coupled microservices with the Flask framework and Apache Kafka.

<h2>
Talk:
Everyday Design Patterns: Observer Pattern
</h2>
<p>
The Observer Pattern enables us to design event-driven systems using loosely coupled components. In this talk, we will learn how, when, and why to use this pattern; we will explore how popular PyPI packages use the pattern; and, we will design a decorator-based Observer to process GitHub events.

Talk:
Great Snake Variation: Programming with python-chess!
</h2>
<p>
Since The Queen’s Gambit hit Netflix, the number of people playing chess online has skyrocketed. Chances are, some of them are Pythonistas! We’ll dive into python-chess: a library for representing the chess board. Along the way, I’ll show how the library also teaches useful programming concepts.

<h2>
Talk:
Lint All the Things!
</h2>
<p>
Code that’s uniform is easier to read, write, and debug, but writing down your standards and conventions in a README that no one reads isn’t enough. The explosion of CI and linter tools allow you to no only document your standards and conventions, but make sure people actually adhere to them.

<h2>
Talk:
Managing the Test Data Nightmare
</h2>
<p>
Good test data can be a nightmare to manage! It can make-or-break testing efforts. Should we preload our databases? Should we use dynamically-generated dummy data? What about collisions? Let’s cover practical strategies for handling data both in our products and in our test cases.

<h2>
Talk:
Minimum Viable Security for Python Applications
</h2>
<p>
Python remains a very popular programming and scripting language in the DevOps ecosystem for building CI/CD pipelines. In the same way we think about how we design and build our Python applications, we need to design, build and automate security into our applications from the ground floor.

<h2>
Talk:
Pragmatic Security Automation and DevSecOps in the Cloud with Python
</h2>
<p>
Manually performing security operations and auditing procedures on a regular basis take a lot of skill, time, and discipline. In this session, we will talk about how to use Python to build different security tools and DevSecOps pipelines to automate different security tasks and responsibilities.

<h2>
Talk:
Stand Back!: Building a scientific computing lab on public clouds with Python
</h2>
<p>
As a citizen scientist, you want to learn more, but you’re hitting the limits of your computer. In this live demo, we’ll use Python to build a data lab on a public cloud. We’ll use that infrastructure to explore public data, and we’ll learn a bit more about “the cloud” along the way.

<h2>
Talk:
xfail and skip: What to do with tests you know will fail
</h2>
<p>
What do you do with a test you know will fail? Skip it? Mark it as xfail? Or wait until the test is passing before adding it to your test suite?

In this talk, I’ll explain `pytest`’s `skipif` and `xfail`, and dive into various strategies for dealing with tests that will not pass.
